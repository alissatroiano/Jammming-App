# Jammming Spotify Playlist App
Jammming is a web-based application that allows users to search for songs, create new playlists, edit the playlist titles and upload the playlists to their personal Spotify accounts.

# Authors

- This Project Build: Alissa Troiano

# Overview
This application was built with React as a project for Codecademy.com's Intensive Front-End Web Developer course.

This application allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account. Individual songs/tracks can be both added and removed from the New Playlist by using the corresponding + and - buttons. Playlist titles may be renamed and each playlist will be successfully saved to the user's account as soon as they click the "Save Playlist" button.

A live demo of my version of this Codecademy Project / App was successfully deployed with Surge and can be viewed at this link: http://dragon_dance.surge.sh
